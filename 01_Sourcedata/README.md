# DR-RisSen-05
This is Experiment 5 in RisSen project.  
Participants are given two tasks which are interleaved with eachother; an orientation reproduction task and a opt in/opt out task.
Participants are shown an array of 12 gratings of which they must average the orientations to accurately reproduce the orientation or accepts or reject gambles which can either gain or lose them points.
The 12 gratings were sampled randomly from a von Mises distribution defined by mean and kappa parameters.  
Different orientations are worth different number of points and participants task is to collect as many point as they can.  
The Reject option was always worth 0 points.
the Accept option was worth either a gain or loss of between -11 and +11 points.
The value of the gratings are computed as the cosine of it's orientation and rescaled to 0-1 range.
All orientations ranged from -90 to 90 degrees.
